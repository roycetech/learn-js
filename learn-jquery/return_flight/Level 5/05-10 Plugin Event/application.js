/** For each tour that we are using our "photofy" plugin on, we'll want to do a few things.

For starters create an event handler using on, that targets the .see-photos link within each .tour. When this is clicked, run a function that will add a class of is-showing-photofy to the tour. You'll probably want to save a reference to this outside of your event handler, and use that in the click event handler. */
