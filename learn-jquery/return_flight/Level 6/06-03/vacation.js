/** You have a piece of javascript code which uses an AJAX call to find the vacation price of cities. This code may be useful to use in a few different parts of your site. Lets go ahead and rewrite this to make it reusable.

Create a Vacation JavaScript object which contains a getPrice function which takes one argument: location. Add the AJAX call currently in the application.js file to the getPrice function. Make sure this function returns a promise. Our "Update Price" button won't call it yet, but we'll do that next. */

var Vacation = {
    getPrice: function(location) {
        return $.ajax('/vacation/prices', {
          data: {q: location},
          success: function(result){
            $('.price').text(result.price);
          }
        });
    }
};
